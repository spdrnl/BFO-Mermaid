# BFO-Mermaid
A repository to reflect Mermaid modeling options for BFO.

The repository focuses on how to effectively express BFO snippets in Mermaid. Examples should make sense BFO wise, but it is the Mermaid notation that has the focus.

### Legend
- Universals are modeled as yellow boxes.
- Instances are modeled as purple diamonds.
- Literals are modeled as white boxes.
- Direct relationships are modeled as solid arrows.
- Relationships that skip modeling steps for brevity are modeled as dotted arrows.

### Criteria
Criteria for Mermaid modeling options are:
- Readability
- Writeability
